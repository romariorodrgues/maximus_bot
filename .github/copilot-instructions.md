# Copilot Instructions for Maximus Robot Project

<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is an Arduino-based autonomous robot project called "Maximus". The robot features:
- Autonomous movement with track-based locomotion using DC motors
- Remote control capabilities
- Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors
- Expressive eyes display
- Head movement with servo motor
- Arm movements with servo motors

## Code Guidelines
- Use modular Arduino C++ code structure
- Follow Arduino coding conventions
- Include proper pin definitions and configurations
- Add comprehensive comments for hardware connections
- Implement safety features for motor control
- Use non-blocking code patterns where possible
- Include error handling for sensor readings

## Hardware Considerations
- Target platform: Arduino Mega 2560 (for sufficient pins)
- Use motor driver shields for DC motor control
- Implement proper power management
- Include safety mechanisms for servo operations
- Follow Arduino pin assignment best practices

## Documentation Requirements
- Include detailed component lists with part numbers
- Provide clear wiring diagrams
- Add assembly instructions with photos/diagrams
- Include calibration procedures
- Document troubleshooting steps
